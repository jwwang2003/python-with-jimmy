# Exercise: Classes — Triangle Area

## Goal

Define a `Triangle` class that stores base and height, computes its area, and
provides a readable string representation.

## Tasks

1. **[Part 1]** Implement `Triangle.__init__` to save `base` and `height`.
2. **[Part 1]** Implement an `area` method that returns `0.5 * base * height`.
3. **[Part 1]** Override `__str__` to return a helpful summary string.
4. **[Part 2]** In the `__main__` block, create an example triangle, print its
   area, and print the object itself (which will use `__str__`).
5. **[Already done]** Keep the provided `solve(test_case)` helper so the
   autograder can validate your logic.

## How to Run

Use the helper script from the repository root:

```bash
./run triangle demo   # view the reference demo
./run triangle test   # run your code and built-in demo/tests
./run triangle grade  # run the official autograder
```
