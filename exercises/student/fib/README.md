# Exercise: Recursion — Fibonacci Numbers

## Goal

Write a recursive function to compute Fibonacci numbers and practice tracing
base cases vs. recursive calls.

## Tasks

1. **[Part 1]** Implement the base cases and recursive step for `fib_recursive`.
2. **[Part 2]** Use the function in the `__main__` block to print a sample value
   and a short sequence.
3. **[Already done]** Keep the provided `solve(test_case)` helper so the
   autograder can validate your logic.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `exercises/student/fib/main.py` | Starter code with TODOs for this exercise. |

## How to Run

Use the helper script from the repository root:

```bash
./run fib demo   # view the reference demo
./run fib test   # run your code and built-in demo/tests
./run fib grade  # run the official autograder
```
