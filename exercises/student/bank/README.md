# Exercise: Intro to Classes — BankAccount

## Goal

Model a simple bank account using a Python class while practicing object-oriented
concepts such as constructors, methods, and encapsulated state.

## Tasks

1. **[Part 1]** Implement `BankAccount.__init__` with `owner` and `starting_balance`.
2. **[Part 1]** Implement `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_summary`.
3. **[Part 2]** Use the class in the main block to simulate two accounts and print their
   summaries.
4. **[Already done]** Complete the `solve(test_case)` helper so the autograder can validate your
   logic across many randomly generated scenarios.

./run bank test   # run your code and built-in demo/tests
./run bank grade  # run the official autograder
```
